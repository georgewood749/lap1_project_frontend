# Maulorum - Blog Project

## Project Description
- The aim was to create a small journaling website allowing users to post journal entries that are then passed to a server.

- Users can create a post including text (limited to 180 characters in our case) and a gif (fetched from giphy using their search API) under a pseudonym of their choice.

- Previous posts are displayed and can be scrolled through using the arrows. Users can react with emojis as well as comment on the posts creating a thread.

## Installation and Usage
### Installation
- Frontend hosted on Netlify: https://maulorum.netlify.app/#
- Backend hosted on Render: https://maulers-server.onrender.com/

### Usage
When on the website, you will automatically be shown the most recent post in the bottom box, and will be able to make a post within the top box on the page.

Simply type in your post, up to a character limit of 180 characters (count is dynamically displayed). You can also optionally enter your name, and choose a gif from the Giphy library. Enter your search term and click "Add gif", 4 gifs will then be displayed to choose from. Select the gif you want to use by clicking on it (a green box will signal that you have selected a gif).

Once you have entered the desired post, press submit and the data will be posted to the backend of our site.

You'll be able to look through previously posted entries, and react to them from a choice of three reactions (you can only react once per post). You will alos be able to view previous comments and leave a comment of your own.
