# Maulorum - Lap 1 blog project

## Project Description
The task for this project was to create a small journaling website that allows the user to post journal entries that are then passed to a server.

The post that a user can create should allow them to include text (limited to 180 characters in our case), a gif (fetched from giphy using their search API), and we chose to allow the author of th post to optionally include their name with the post.

Users are allowed to view past posts, and they can scroll through previous posts using a left and right button.

When users are viewing past entries, they are able to see the full text of the post, the author name (if applicable), the gif (if applicable), any comments that have been made on this entry, and the count of each reaction type. 

Users can also leave their own comments on past posts, which are posted to the server for the next user to be able to view.


## Installation and Usage
### Installation
Both the frontend and backend of this site have been hosted online. The frontend has been hosted using Netlify, and the backend on Render.

To access the website, simply head to https://maulorum.netlify.app/#.

To access the backend of the website to browse the data, head to https://maulers-server.onrender.com/.

### Usage
When on the website, you will automatically be shown the most recent post in the bottom box, and will be able to make a post within the top box on the page.

Simply type in your post, up to a character limit of 180 characters (count is dynamically displayed). You can also optionally enter your name, and choose a gif from the Giphy library. Enter your search term and click "Add gif", 4 gifs will then be displayed to choose from. Select the gif you want to use by clicking on it (a green box will signal that you have selected a gif).

Once you have entered the desired post, press submit and the data will be posted to the backend of our site.

You'll be able to look through previously posted entries, and react to them from a choice of three reactions (you can only react once per post). You will alos be able to view previous comments and leave a comment of your own.
